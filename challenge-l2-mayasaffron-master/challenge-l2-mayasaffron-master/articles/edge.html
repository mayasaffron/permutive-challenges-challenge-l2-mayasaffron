    <h1>Edge computing</h1>
    
    Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. The origins of edge computing lie in content delivery networks that were created in the late 1990s to serve web and video content from edge servers that were deployed close to users. In the early 2000s, these networks evolved to host applications and application components at the edge servers,[3] resulting in the first commercial edge computing services[4] that hosted applications such as dealer locators, shopping carts, real-time data aggregators, and ad insertion engines. Modern edge computing significantly extends this approach through virtualization technology that makes it easier to deploy and run a wider range of applications on the edge servers.
    
    One definition of edge computing is any type of computer program that delivers low latency nearer to the requests. Karim Arabi, in an IEEE DAC 2014 Keynote [5] and subsequently in an invited talk at MIT's MTL Seminar in 2015 [6] defined edge computing broadly as all computing outside the cloud happening at the edge of the network, and more specifically in applications where real-time processing of data is required. In his definition, cloud computing operates on big data while edge computing operates on "instant data" that is real-time data generated by sensors or users.

According to The State of the Edge report, edge computing concentrates on servers "in close proximity to the last mile network."[citation needed] Alex Reznik, Chair of the ETSI MEC ISG standards committee loosely defines the term: "anything that's not a traditional data center could be the 'edge' to somebody."[7]

Edge nodes used for game streaming are known as gamelets,[8] which are usually one or two hops away from the client.[9] Per Anand and Edwin say 'the edge node is mostly one or two hops away from the mobile client to meet the response time constraints for real-time games' in the cloud gaming context.[9]
