    <h1>Fibonacci number</h1>
    <p>The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

      0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
      
      The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:
      
      the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
      the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
      the 5 is (2+3),
      and so on!
