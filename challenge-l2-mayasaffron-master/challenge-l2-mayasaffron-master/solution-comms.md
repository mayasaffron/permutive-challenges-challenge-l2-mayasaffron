** Communication Asessment

1.	What actions do you take? What types of resources would you leverage? Please outline your investigative steps including any internal and client-facing communication.
Locate the cohort via the Permutive dashboard and find out 
-	How long ago they were created
-	their estimated audience size. 
-	The criteria of the cohort 
o	If the criteria of the cohort happens to be extremely specific and less likely to occur more than once in 30 days (and the cohort was created over 30 days ago) This will help us understand why the live audience size is lower, if users have not repeated the criteria actions again during the 30 days since creation, they will have been removed, reducing the live audience size. 

With the above information I will now explain this to the client and ask if any of the information I have provided explains why the live audience size may be smaller than expected, there could have perhaps been internal issues on their side, within the last 30 days, stopping users from being able to access the actions necessary for them to still be in the cohort. I will also remind the client of the difference between the Predicted Audience Size and live audience size as the issue could simply be a misunderstanding on the clients side of what one would expect to see for each audience. 



I will review my findings with my peers to see if they agree with my approach 


2.	You think you found the root cause, but you will have to escalate to the engineering team for resolution. Draft a communication to the engineering team for your escalation. Please include the types of information from your investigation you would send to the engineering team.
-	Hi there, 
I have investigated an issue from a client with the live audience size. The client reported that the live audience size of a cohort was significantly lower than expected. After investigating I can surmise that the issue is with a miscommunication in the cohort criteria, this is solved by adjusting the criteria. I would like to avoid having to create a new cohort altogether and wondered if there was a way we could update the criteria for this existing cohort. If so, please let me know how or how I can support you with doing so, is there any additional information you need from the client or me?
Thank you

-	I would screenshots/ screen recordings of where I think the issue lies. 
-	I would not send any screen shots/ of the communications with the clients, from my experience engineers want all of the information from the internal after it has been digested and translated. 
- If the issue is something other than I have unsderstood, I will tell them if/ how I recreated the bug/ issue. Again, engineers wnat all the information and working out done as much as possible, so that they can just solve. 

3.	The engineering team has begun working on a fix. Engineering has not given you an expected completion date on the fix. The client has asked for an update by the end of the business day. What do you do? What do you communicate back to the client?
-	I ask the engineering team how long they expect the bug will take to resolve, I tell the client and provide a workaround if the resolution is likely to take longer than a day. 
- I would encourgae the negineers to do a tech spike, depending on how rucioal this ussue is, engineers may be workingon other iossues tht are more pressing, but if we have capacity i would ask engineers to carry out a tech spoike and let me kow how long the resoloution will take, so that I can provide the client with accurate timelines. 
As ke the client their deadlines, so.t that hopefully this can be aligned with tht enegineers.
